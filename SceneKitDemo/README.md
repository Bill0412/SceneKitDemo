# SceneKit Demo

## Intro

This is a demo that shows you how you can manipulate data in Swift SceneKit using your customized functions in C/C++.

## Demo

When you run the program, you should move your camera so that a shape comprised of 5 cylinders connetected end by end can be constructed. The position of the joints are determined by your camera position in 5 seconds, every 1 second camera position data as a sampling point.

After 5 seconds, the shape you created by your phone will move up 0.01m every 1 second.
